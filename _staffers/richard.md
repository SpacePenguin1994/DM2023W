Hey all! My name is Richard - I grew up in Redondo Beach, CA and went to community college before graduating from University of California, San Diego in 2020. I started my career at Google immediately after graduation and am currently WFH in Irvine, CA. I am discovering a passion for helping out students with mock interviews, tutoring, hackathon mentorship, etc. Hope to see you all in my Office Hours at some point - no technical questions required. 

If you email me, please put [CSCI-100] in the subject line.
