Hello all, my name is Aditya Mithas and I am a software engineer at Google. I have been working on the Google Assistant ("Hey Google, ...") for almost two years, and previously contributed to Google Cloud efforts. I grew up not far from you all, in Montgomery County, Maryland, and am now based out of New York City.

I'm incredibly excited to work with all of you this fall, and am looking forward to helping you achieve your goals in academics and the industry.
