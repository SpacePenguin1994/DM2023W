I am a 4th year graduate student at Howard University working with Prof. Danda B. Rawat in the CWiNs lab. My research works mostly involve wireless virtualization and cyber physical systems. For this academic year, I am working as an adjunct lecturer in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department. If you have any questions regarding graduate or undergraduate research in computer science, Iâ€™d be happy to chat with you about it.
