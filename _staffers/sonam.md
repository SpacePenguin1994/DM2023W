Hi all! I'm a Software Engineer in Google's NYC office, working on features related to education within YouTube. I've previously worked on Ads and Search. I'm originally from Texas and I went to UT Austin (I started college with zero knowledge in Computer Science), interned at Google twice, then returned full time! I'm a beginner rock climber but spend a lot of my free time trying to improve. Looking forward to meeting you all :)
