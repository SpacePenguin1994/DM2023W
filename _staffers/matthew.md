Hi everyone! I’m a software engineer at Google, working on the test infrastructure for the UI frameworks of the YouTube mobile apps. I’m born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area and I studied computer science at UC Berkeley, where I taught the data structures course and graduated in 2019. I enjoy bouldering and a warm mug of London Fog.
