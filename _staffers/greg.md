Hello all! I am a SWE on the Cloud Code for IntelliJ team located in NYC. Our team focuses on making it easy for individual developers, software development teams, and whole enterprises to use GCP and cloud native development practices in general without having to context switch between the GCP Console and an IDE or understand some of the complicated tools involved. Prior to Google, I worked for a couple startups and then WeWork (which, if you've seen any of the reporting or the documentary, you'll know was quite the experience). Right now I'm working on developer tools of course, but in the past I've worked primarily on full stack web development and devops projects, so have some experience there that might be helpful too. Looking forward to meeting and working with everyone!

If you email me, please put \[CSCI-100\] in the subject line.
