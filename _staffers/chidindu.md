Hi everyone, I’m Chidindu (Dindu) Alim. I’m currently interested in Product Management, Human-Computer interactions, Machine Learning and Gamification. I’ve been carrying out research since my freshman year at the ABL lab here at Howard University. Also, I’ve had a Software engineering internship at Uber and a Software engineering and product management internship at Microsoft. I’m happy to share more of my experience so far with you!
