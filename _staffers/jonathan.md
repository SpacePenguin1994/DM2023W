My name is Jonathan Flores. I am a sophomore international student at Howard University majoring in Computer Science. I am from Trinidad and Tobago (an island in the Caribbean). I am still figuring out what path I want to take in Computer Science. I am willing to answer any questions about by journey so far in Computer Science, especially as it relates to my experience as an international student.
