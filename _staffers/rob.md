Hi, I'm Robinson Raju Varghese. You can call me Rob or Robinson. I've been in software development and engineering management for close to 20 years, mostly focused on e-commerce and Payments. In the last 5 years, I've been studying and doing some research on Security. I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from San Jose State. I enjoyed doing research on IoT security during this time. I'm currently working on Google Cloud Security, focused on the Zero Trust platform. 

I live in California (SF Bay Area) with my wife and our little puppy. I love to go on hikes and long walks and visits to the beach occasionally. I like to read and watch sci-fi books and TV series. Awaiting Dune, Foundation & The Wheel of Time series. Looking forward to learning and getting to know you this fall.
