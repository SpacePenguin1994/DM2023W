## Overview
CSCI100 is an introductory class designed for students with no formal exposure to computer science or programming. The goal is to provide a gentle but thorough introduction to computer science that will prepare students to either take further computer science courses, or use computer science in their field of study.

By the end of the course, students will learn
 - Variables, Expressions, Types
 - Input/Output
 - Logic and Control Flow
 - Functions
 - Recursion
 - Basic algorithms, runtime and efficiency
 - Objects and Classes
 - Sets and Dictionaries

## Course Meetings
Lectures, labs, and office hours are the main ways in which you will interact with your professor and TAs. You can see the weekly schedule of course meetings on the [course schedule page](schedule.md).
### Lecture
Lectures will be a mix of lectures covering new material, coding demos, and in-class problem solving. Due to the size of the course, lectures will be held

I will be releasing pre-recorded videos covering the topics from lecture the day *after* the in-person lecture, for students who would like to review the material or may have missed class. These pre-recorded lectures will not be as useful as in-class lectures as they are not interactive, and you will **not** receive attendance credit for only watching the pre-recorded lecture.

### Labs
Labs will be the main in-class place to apply the new concepts that you're learning in lecture. You will be given problems to solve, that you'll be able to work on with your peers. Your labs will be submitted on Mimir and graded by the Mimir autograder. Labs will be released each Thursday morning, and will be due the following Tuesday. 

You should take advantage of labs as you can ask the professor or TAs for help on completing the assignments. 

### Office Hours

We will hold a mixture of in-person and virtual office hours at a wide variety of times. Virtual office hours will be held on Zoom, the link can be found at the [course schedule page](schedule.md). In-person office hours will be held in Prof. Krentsel's office. You are welcome to come for any reason, including course material questions, lecture clarifications, industry interview prep, career path discussions, or just to hang out. 

As a course, we commit to making sure no student fails the class due to lack of class resources, so if you are behind or confused, please reach out for help. The course staff will make themselves as available as possible to help you.

## Policies

### Grades

The grading policy is to-be-announced.

### Attendance
Class attendance will be part of your grade. You'll be expected to attend all lectures and labs. You're allowed to miss up to 2 lectures during the semester. Attendance will be taken each lecture by a short ungraded quiz given on the lecture material at a random time. You will not be scored on the correctness of your answers on these in-class quizzes.

### Assignments

The assignments policy is to-be-announced.

### Exams

There will be one midterm held around the middle of the semester. The date is to-be-announced.

### Cheating

For all assignments in the course, you may discuss approaches to solving a problem or work in the same room on separate computers to individually solve a problem, but **you may *not* copy and paste code or substantially copy ideas from another student**. It can be tempting to cheat. Know that Mimir's autograder has a very good plagiarism detector. Any assignment found to be plagiarized will be zero-ed out for all students with matching code, and the students will be referred to the universty for academic dishonesty. 

If I ask you how your code works and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don't take the risk. Despite this explicit warning, each year, multiple students still cheat and are caught. 

The course staff will work tirelessly to provide enough support for any student to get help and make it through the class. In exchange, we ask you to uphold academic integrity and not to plagiarize code or ideas. 

## Resources

This course website, [csci100.org](csci100.org), will be your one-stop resource for the syllabus, schedule, lecture videos, and assignment links. Additionally, we will be using the following software.

**Blackboard**
Your official class grade will be in Blackboard. You should already have a Blackboard account. Get in touch with your advisor if you can't access the course on Blackboard.

**Mimir**
You will get a link to sign up for this tool when we begin class. We will use Mimir for editing and turning in assignments. Note that Mimir may display a “grade” for you, but the official one is in Blackboard.

**Discord**
Discord is a free chat app which we will use for Q&A outside of the classroom. 

**Zoom**
In light of the large class size and COVID risks, our weekly lectures and labs will be taught virtually over Zoom.

### Material Attribution
We'd like to thank UC Berkeley's [CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://cs10.org/fa19/) and [CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa15/), from which this course borrows high-level topics and organization. Course material will be created by Prof. Alex Krentsel, borrowing from past iterations of this course at Howard taught by GIR instructors.
