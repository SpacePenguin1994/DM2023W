# Mock Interview
In addition to hosting office hours, our Google Engineers on course staff will provide free mock interviews to you based on the material that you've learned in the class and the requirements of the STEP internship. 

## Signing up

Use the button below to sign up for a mock interview slot with one of the Google TAs. Click on one of the empty appointment slots and click save to book it. You may do **at most 2 mock interviews**, to ensure that there are enough interviews avaialble for your classmaters. 

[Schedule a Mock Interview](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UU1kU0hnS0VoOUM0fGRlZmF1bHR8NzVjM2ExNmY1YzBlZDE1YTE0MWMzODNhMDJlZWJjNzA){: .btn .btn-outline }

If after one mock interview you want further experience, consider spending 2-3 weeks working on practice problems and then schedule a second session with a different interviewer.

## What will the mock interviews be like?

The goal of the interviews is to simulate what real technical interviews may be like with various companies, so you can better understand what to expect. The goal of these interviews specifically is *not* to teach you brand new content (e.g. a question requires a data structure but you’ve never heard of it before), so please tell your mock interviewer if they are asking you something you haven’t learned yet.

Your interviewer will come prepared with a question (or maybe a few, depending on question difficulty). Don’t be afraid to ask clarifying questions - the interview should feel more like a conversation and less like an interrogation. If something is confusing, talk through it with your interviewer and they can help push you in the right direction.

Afterwards, your interviewer will provide you with feedback as well as tips on how to improve your interviewing skills. 

## What are some good resources to help you prepare?

- Review [content learned in class](https://csci100.org/calendar/)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) is a solid book to learn or review core CS concepts and how to use them in interviews 
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) have tons of practice questions with automatic testing

## Doing More Mock Interviews
