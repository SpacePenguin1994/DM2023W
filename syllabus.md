## Overview

This class is the mathematical foundation of computer science. Within this course, students will acquire a specific collection of mathematical principles and learn how to apply them. Significantly, the course will cultivate logical and mathematical thinking abilities among students. Upon completing this course, students will have obtained a solid grasp of all the requisite mathematical foundations necessary for their future studies in computer science.

By the end of the course, students will learn:
-  Proposition Logic and Predicate Logic
-  Set Theory and Binary Relations
-  Algebraic Structure
-  Some basic Combinatorics
-  Graph Theory
-  Elementary Number Theory


## Policies

### Cheating

You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates or utilize online resources for any problem you meet in the homework or in the class. Actually, you can also ask for the instructor.  **However, directly copying answers is prohibited.** If I ask you how your code works or why your answers are correct and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don’t take the risk. 

### Homework

TBA.

### Final Exam

TBA.
### Grades

Students' grades**Grade**{:.label.label-green} will be determined by the following  two components:
-  Homework**HW**{:.label.label-green},
-  Final Exam**Exam**{:.label.label-green},


The final grade will be calculated using the following equation:

: **Grade**{:.label.label-green} = 30%* **HW**{:.label.label-green} +  70%* **Exam**{:.label.label-green} 


## Resources

This course website, [Discrete Mathematics](../DM2023W/index.md), will be your one-stop resource for the syllabus, schedule and homework links.
