Exam 2 is coming up on Monday, November 1st.

To help you prepare for Exam 2, we have put together a practice exam which you can take in order to find how you are doing. While this is optional, we highly encourage you to go through it as it will be a good way to prepare for the exam.

If you want to compare answers or ask any questions, please post publicly on Piazza so other students can see the questions and help answer. 

You can find the practice exam here: [www.shortl.io/csci100-practice-exam-2](www.shortl.io/csci100-practice-exam-2)

In addition to this, the best ways to prepare for the exam are:

Complete all classwork assignments (mostly from September 20th (Functions) to October 25th (Pass-by-reference vs Pass-by-value))
Review individual lecture videos on the topics you are rusty about
Complete Project 1, HW 04, Lab 09 (at least Part I & II) (as they are due this week and their topics will appear on the exam) 
Ask questions on topics or ideas that are not 100% clear to you. Don't just blindly accept the answer to be something.
Make sure you are comfortable with the following topics: 
- Functions
- Lists
- Mutability
- Input/Output
- Dictionaries
- 2D Lists
- Nested loops

Piazza is the place to ask questions - emails to me will take >24 hours to be replied to, on Piazza you can get a much quicker response (in fact, the average response time on Piazza currently is a blazing-fast 12 minutes).

Happy studying!
