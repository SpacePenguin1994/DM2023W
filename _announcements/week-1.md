Per department request, all class lectures and labs will be virtual, at least for the first few weeks of class, then we will re-evaluate. 

Please join the class Piazza by following the sign-up instructions you received by email. If you did not receive them, or are joining the class late, click [https://piazza.com/howard/fall2021/csci100](https://piazza.com/howard/fall2021/csci100) to sign up directly. If you have any questions, please ask there rather than emailing me directly.

Office hours will be offered in person and virtually, please see the [schedule tab](https://csci100.org/schedule/) for up-to-date times and locations for office hours.
