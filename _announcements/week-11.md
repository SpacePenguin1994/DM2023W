The final project for the course has been released, and is available on Mimir. It is shared between CSCI100 and CSCI120 - you will need to do if it you are in either class.

The course project requires implementing your very own search engine, using a simplified version of the same approach that Google uses to provide search results. There is a detailed instructions doc available in the assignment on Mimir.

Part 1 is due on 11/16/2021 at 11:59 AM (notice the AM! at noon).
