Hi everyone,

As this cybersecurity situation continues to evolve, I have a few updates for you on the class schedule for this week. 

1.  **Lecture on Wednesday (tomorrow) is converted to an office hour**. You are not required to attend, but if you do, Vijay, the TAs, and I will be available to answer questions and help with assignments.
2.  You are **still expected to watch the lectures videos on your phone for this week**. If you have no wifi, please watch them on your phone with your data plan. I have used large fonts so they are watchable on your phone. If you are unable to watch them on your phones, please post on Piazza so we can help find alternative ideas for you to watch them.
3.  Starting this week, I have added many more additional Office Hours to the [class calendar](https://csci100.org/schedule/) thanks to the Google TAs. Please drop by with any questions on classwork, homework, labwork, or computer science in general.

The situation for Thursday's lab is still unclear. As of now, **assume we will have lab unless the university says otherwise**. We will follow university guidance - if they cancel class on Thursday, we will convert the lab class into office hours. If they do not cancel class, we will have lab as scheduled on Thursday. If we have lab, then I will answer questions about the lecture videos for the first 20 minutes of class, then we will work as usual on a shorter lab for the remainder of the class. 

Finally, Mimir's IDE seems to be down currently. Because of this, I've extended the due date for Lab 2 by two days to this Friday at midnight. If Mimir continues to be down through tomorrow, I'll extend the deadline further. In the meantime, you can use [replit.com](https://replit.com) to write code and submit the files that you code via the green submit button on the assignment page. Replit is another cloud-based IDE, just like the Mimir IDE, but provided by a different company. You can follow the instructions in my answer in [https://piazza.com/class/ksjaetb15k147d?cid=71](https://piazza.com/class/ksjaetb15k147d?cid=71) to get signed up and start coding. Please ask on Piazza if you have any problems setting it up.

Hope to see you all soon!
