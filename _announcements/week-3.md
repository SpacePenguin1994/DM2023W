A couple small announcement bundled into one:

1. Homework 2 is out now, and will be due Sunday, September 12th at midnight. 
2. The quiz policy will be that I will drop the lowest 2 quiz grades of the semester. If your internet quality prevented you from completing the quiz last week, make sure to find somewhere with stronger internet this week. You can either find a workspace on campus, like the Google space, or you can hotspot or use the internet on your phone. Future quizzes will have coding questions in class, so you will likely want to do them on your computer.
3. I've updated the course schedule page to use Google Calendar, which will be easier to keep in sync and updated each week.
