I've created the extra-credit filters gallery and put it up on the website. You can find it at [https://csci100.org/filters/](https://csci100.org/filters/)

Please take a look and then vote on your top 3 favorite filters at [www.shortl.io/csci100-filter-vote](www.shortl.io/csci100-filter-vote) by Friday, December 3rd at 11:59pm. The winners will receive some extra-extra credit.

Thanks to everyone who submitted filters. If you made a custom filter but didn't send me before/after demo images, email me at akrentsel@csci100.org so I we can get your submission on the gallery page (and so I can give you extra credit).
