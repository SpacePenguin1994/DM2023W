This week's announcement is made up of 3 mini-announcements:

**STEP Internship Application**
The STEP internship application opened 9/14, and is a rolling application. I highly encourage you to apply as soon as possible - ideally by the end of the week. Click [here](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/) to go to the application page.

**Assignment Late Policy**
Reminder on the late policy for this class: all labs and homeworks can be turned in up to 5 days late. You will only lose 10% per day that the assignment is late (e.g. an assignment 2 days late can get up to 80% credit). We will also be dropping the lowest lab grade at the end of the semester. So if you can't finish an assignment by the due date, it's okay - keep working on it and submit it late for partial credit!

**Exam Grading**
We are in the process of grading your exam, and hope to have the exam graded for you by next Monday.
