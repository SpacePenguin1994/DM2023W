Hi,guys. You need to know the following two things:

- Considering the course schedule, [Homework #3](https://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~yangqizhe/pdf/dm2023w/homework/DM-hw3.pdf) only needs to finish the problem 1, 2, and 3 this week. And please remember that if you don't finish problem 4 in [Homework #2](https://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~yangqizhe/pdf/dm2023w/homework/DM-hw2.pdf) last week, you should solve it this time.

- We have set up a questionaire for the course. And I wish you can actively provide the feedback about this course. See more information in [Algorithm](../).

Happy Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day!
