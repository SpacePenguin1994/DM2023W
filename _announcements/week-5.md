Exam 1 is coming up this coming Wednesday, 9/22. It will cover all of the content up through the end of last week: binary, variables, expressions, string functions, conditionals, while loops, and for loops.

The course staff has put together a practice exam for you in the same format as the actual exam. It has more questions than the actual exam, but the same kinds of questions.
You can find the practice exam here: [www.shortl.io/csci100-practice-exam1](www.shortl.io/csci100-practice-exam1).

In addition to this, the best ways to prepare for the exam are:
- Complete all classwork assignments
- Review individual lecture videos on the topics you are rusty about
- Complete lab3 and lab4 (as they are due on Wednesday and their topics will be on the exam)
- Ask questions on topics or ideas that are not 100% clear to you. Don't just blindly accept the answer to be something - make sure you understand *why* an expression evaluates to what it does, or *why* to use a for loop over a while loop or vice versa.

Good luck!
