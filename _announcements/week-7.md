The TAs have been hard at work grading, and have completed grading all ~170 of your exams. We have just released your grade to you on Mimir. **Your exam score denominator is 106 points, not 61 as Mimir says.** For example, if Mimir says your score is "50/61", your actual score is "50/106". This is because of how Mimir handles the code editor questions. 

Read on below to understand how you did on the exam, where to find solutions, how to request a regrade, and what you can do if you're unhappy with your grade. 

<ins>**Distribution**</ins>

You can see the distribution of the exam by clicking here [here](https://piazza.com/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Ficguy5cby5q1ok%2F90fd37a2367ff474f13c05e757622b2ad55c136767c294533b89ef6392cd543e%2Fimage.png).

To help you understand how you're doing, we've come up with the following _approximate_ buckets (out of 106). Note that these buckets are just guidance for what level you're performing at. These are _not_ your final grade, nor are they your midterm grade. Your midterm grade may be lower or higher, based on a variety of factors.

<table cellpadding="6px" border="1px" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>85-106</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>~61-84</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>~50-60</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>35-50</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>34 and lower</td></tr></tbody></table>

<ins>**Solutions**</ins>

Solutions to the 3 versions of the exam can be found at:

*   [www.shortl.io/rubric-v1](https://www.shortl.io/rubric-v1)
*   [www.shortl.io/rubric-v2](https://www.shortl.io/rubric-v2)
*   [www.shortl.io/rubric-v3](https://www.shortl.io/rubric-v3)

I encourage you to look through the solutions for your version of the exam. I also encourage you to come to office hours to talk through the solutions for any problem you missed. TAs can help give you hints on how to approach problems when you feel stuck.

**<ins>Regrade Requests</ins>**

TAs are humans too, and make mistakes while grading (albeit rarely). After reviewing your exam and the solutions/rubric, you can use the form at [www.shortl.io/csci100-exam1-regrade](https://www.shortl.io/csci100-exam1-regrade) to request a regrade on any question where you believe there was a mistake in grading. Please submit one re-grade request \*per question\* that you feel was graded incorrectly.

<ins>**If you're unhappy with your grade**</ins>

*   This of this exam as a wakeup call. You can absolutely still get your grade up higher (even all the way up to an A), based on how points are structured in this course and with the clobber policy (details below).
*   <ins>Come get help</ins>. We are offering ~30 hours of office hours a week, hosted by our large team of TAs. Come to office hours and ask a TA to look over your exam with you. _We are here to help you succeed_.

Clobber Policy:

*   If you didn't do as well as you had wanted on Midterm 1, we will be offering a way for you to recover points on midterm 1 based on your final exam score. More details to come later in the semester. 

Best,
CSCI100 Course Staff
