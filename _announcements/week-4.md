Considering the course schedule, [Homework #2](https://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/~yangqizhe/pdf/dm2023w/homework/DM-hw2.pdf) only needs to finish the problem 1, 2, 3, and 5 this week.

- Please note that we have modified the problem 2 to just require finding the Conjunctive Normal Form (合取范式，CNF)and Disjunctive Normal Form(析取范式，DNF), insteading of finding Canonical Conjunctive Normal Form (主合取范式)and Canonical Disjunctive Normal Form (主析取范式). The PDF will be updated soon later.
