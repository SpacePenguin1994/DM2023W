Some students have been asking about how to get started on the project. I decided to put together 2 short videos showing the very first steps of how to read the instructions, how to understand the multiple files in the code, and how to get the code running. You can find those 2 videos here: [Search Engine Getting Started Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3nHC6eYy_8&list=PLr509y092L29dy9OlXySAFI514X4pXjpS)

Note though that a large part of this project is reading through the project instructions to understand how all parts of the project fit together. So in these videos, I have not told you everything you need to understand for the project. You will need to read the instructions and the comments in the code before you start coding, to understand how the project is structured and what helper functions there are that you should use.

Please ask away on Piazza if you have any questions.
